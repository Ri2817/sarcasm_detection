This repository contains a project focused on detecting sarcasm in text using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to build a model capable of analyzing text data and classifying whether a statement is sarcastic or not.


## Project Overview

Sarcasm detection is an important task in natural language processing (NLP) due to the subtleties and complexities involved in interpreting human communication. In this project, machine learning models are trained on labeled text data to detect sarcasm in statements, which can be used for a variety of applications such as sentiment analysis, social media monitoring, and customer feedback analysis.

### Key Areas of Focus:
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction
- Model training using various machine learning algorithms
- Performance evaluation of sarcasm detection models
- Use of deep learning techniques for better accuracy
